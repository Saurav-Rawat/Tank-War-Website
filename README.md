#Tank-war-website
This is a website that is created by me and my two friends. It is based on a game that we developed on Unity Engine. We tried to make the site more informative about the the game it has an animaton that occurs whenever the page is loaded it is implemented by using eventhandeling using Vanilla JavaScript. also it has a slider of the images of tanks. A page about the developer that we linked and at last if you want to give feedback to to the users you there is an additional feedback page for that.. the website is not yet connected with backend but soon it will be imlemented
